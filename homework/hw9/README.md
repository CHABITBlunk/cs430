#### author: habit blunk

ensure that the library exists and is populated. refer to my scripts for hw7.
ensure that in the same directory as Lab9.java, there is a `.env` that has the user's password in it.
ensure that mariadb-java-client-3.5.3.jar is on `$CLASSPATH`.
usage:

```bash
javac Lab9.java
java Lab9
/usr/bin/mysql -u <user> -D <user> -h helmi -p
source query.sql;
```
