I couldn't add any new books without total_copies. This is a feature of my database since it doesn't make sense to me why someone would want to add a book that has no copies.
I couldn't delete Grace Slick because she has books associated with her.
I couldn't add '96-42013-10510' because it was a duplicate.
I couldn't add 'Growing your own Weeds' to South Park because of issues with pub_id.
