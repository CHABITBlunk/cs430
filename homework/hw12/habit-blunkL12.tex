    \item T1: R(X)
    \item T2: W(X)

    \item T1: W(Y)
    \item T1: commit
    \item T2: commit

  \end{enumerate}


  \subsection*{1. Rigorous 2PL with timestamps using wait-die}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item T1: S-lock(X) -> R(X)
    \item T2: X-lock(X) -> conflict -> T2 dies, remains in queue
    \item T3: X-lock(Y) -> W(Y)
    \item T1: X-lock(Y) -> conflict -> T1 waits, actions (W(Y), commit) queued
    \item T3: commit -> unlock Y -> T1 resumes
    \item T1: X-lock(Y) -> T1: W(Y)
    \item T1: commit -> unlock X, Y -> T2 restarts
    \item T2: X-lock(X) -> W(X)
    \item T2: X-lock(Y) -> W(Y)
    \item T2: commit -> unlock X, Y
  \end{enumerate}


  \subsection*{2. Rigorous 2PL with deadlock detection}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item T1: S-lock(X) -> R(X)
    \item T2: X-lock(X) -> T2 waits, add new edge (T2 -> T1) to graph
    \item T2: queue W(X) and X-lock(Y)
    \item T3: X-lock(Y) -> W(Y)
    \item T1: X-lock(Y) held -> T1 waits, add new edge (T1 -> T3) to graph
    \item T3: commit -> unlock Y -> T1 resumes
    \item T1: X-lock(Y) -> W(Y) -> commit -> unlock X, Y -> T2 restarts
    \item T2: X-lock(X) -> W(X) -> X-lock(Y) -> W(Y) -> commit -> unlock X, Y
  \end{enumerate}
  Waits-for graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item T2 -> T1
    \item T1 -> T3
  \end{itemize}


  \subsection*{3. Timestamp concurrency control with buffering and Thomas write rule}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item T1: R(X) - ok
    \item T2: W(X) - TS(T2) = 2 \geq R_TS(X) = 1 -> ok -> W_TS(X) = 2
    \item T2: W(Y) - ok
    \item T3: W(Y) - TS(T3) = 3 \geq W_TS(Y) = 2 -> ok -> W_TS(Y) = 3
    \item T1: W(Y) - TS(T1) = 1 < W_TS(Y) = 3 -> ignored because obsolete
    \item T1: commit - ok
    \item T2: commit - ok
    \item T3: commit - ok
  \end{enumerate}

  
  \subsection*{4. Validation (optimistic)}
  T1 reads X, writes Y; T2 writes X and Y; T3 writes Y. T1 must commit before T2 to be safe. T1 writes Y, T3 also writes Y -> conflict if overlapping.
  Assuming timestamps reflect validation order, T1 and T2 likely commit, but T3 may abort due to write-write conflict.

  \subsection*{5. MVTO}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item T1: R(X) - ok, reads version with W_TS <= 1
    \item T2: W(X) - ok, new version with W_TS = 2
    \item T2: W(Y) - ok, new version with W_TS = 2
    \item T3: W(Y) - ok, new version with W_TS = 3
    \item T1: W(Y) - W_TS(Y) = 3, TS=1 < W_TS -> reject
    \item T1 aborts
    \item T2 commits
    \item T3 commits
  \end{enumerate}
