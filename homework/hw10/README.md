#### author: habit blunk

ensure that the library exists and is populated. refer to my scripts for hw7.
ensure that in the same directory as `Lab10Blunk.java`, there is a `.env` that has the user's password in it
ensure that mariadb-java-client-3.5.3.jar is on `$CLASSPATH`.
usage:

```bash
javac Lab10Blunk.java
java Lab10Blunk
```

when you want to exit, use "quit", "bye", or "exit". C-c also works at any time.
